shell:startup


Use "Boot Thawed" (one-time thaw) option!
Steps:

Thaw for one session:

Right-click Deep Freeze icon in system tray
Enter password
Select "Boot Thawed" (NOT "Boot Thawed Until Disabled")
Click OK


Restart ← System is now thawed
Download all your files (take your time, no rush)
Restart again ← Deep Freeze automatically re-freezes

That's it! You don't need to manually re-enable freezing.
What "Boot Thawed" does:

Thaws the system for only the next boot session
After you restart again, it automatically goes back to frozen
Your downloaded files are now part of the frozen snapshot
